    \section*{Abstract}
    \label{section:abstract}

    Artistic style transfer has gained a considerable amount of momentum in recent years. We reproduce the result of Champandard, providing our own publicly available implementation. At the core of the algorithm lies the incorporation of human-authored semantic segmentation of input images which can be incorporated into the patch-based style loss in the classic framework for style transfer.
